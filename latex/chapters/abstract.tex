\chapter*{Abstract}
We were presented this project about four weeks ago. It included both differentiation and the use of Newton - Raphsons method. We made use of common pen and paper calculation and coding with the help of the programming language \emph{python}. \\
\\
When calculating the results in part one, numerical approximation to the derivative, we first of all found the derivative to \emph{f(x)}, we then calculated an approximation to \emph{f'(x)} by using a new function called \emph{g(x)}. We also calculated an estimated error, by using a third function called \emph{E(x)}. Both task 1d and task 2 of the first part of the project were done with the help of \emph{python}. The last task of part one, we were asked to find with trial and error, the greatest $\Delta x$ with to desimals, so that $E(x_0) \leq 0.001$. This specific task was done in \emph{python}.\\
\\
For the second part of this project we were asked to use the Newton - Rapshon method so that we can get approximate results for both solutions and the equation. We are also asked to use an estimated error for $E = 10^-^1^2$ and to see how our choice of $x_0$ affected our results. For task two, part two of the project we were asked to calculate the degree $\theta_2$, based on the knowledge of the degree $\theta_1$. When we finished calculating the results to task 2a, 2b and 2c in part two, we were asked to explore the pyshical meaning of the results. For all the tasks on part two we used programs written in \emph{python}\\
